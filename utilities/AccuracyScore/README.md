# Accuracy Score

## Introduction

Accuracy score is one of the performace metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It is a good measure when the target classes are balanced. It is not a good measure when the target classes are imbalanced.
$$ accuracy = {{TP + TN} \over {TP + TN + FP + FN}} $$
where,

- TP = True Positive
- TN = True Negative
- FP = False Positive
- FN = False Negative

## Use Case

Accuracy score is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It is a good measure when the target classes are balanced. It is not a good measure when the target classes are imbalanced.
