# Precision

## Introduction

Precision is the fraction of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions. It is also known as positive predictive value or Sensitivity.

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

where,

- TP = True Positive
- FP = False Positive

## Use Case

Precision is most useful when we want the prediction to match the actual value as closely as possible. For example, in a medical test, we want to minimize the number of false negatives. In this case, we want to maximize the precision. Because, for example, if we predict that a patient does not have a disease, but he actually has it, then it can be very dangerous for the patient.
