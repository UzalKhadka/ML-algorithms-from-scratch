# Train Test Split

## Introduction

Train Test Split is a utility function that splits the Features (X) and Target (y) datasets to a reproducible split. This is useful for comparing different models and hyperparameters. The function takes in a dataset and a test size and returns the train and test datasets. The function also takes in a random state to ensure reproducibility.

## Use Case

Train Test Split is useful to split the dataset into train and test datasets which can be used to train and test the model. Different models can be trained on the train dataset and the test dataset can be used to evaluate models. This is useful to compare different models and hyperparameters.
